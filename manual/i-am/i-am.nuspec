    <description>I AM is efficiënt communiceren op de manier die u het beste uitkomt: bellen, chat, video, of zelfs met meerdere personen tegelijk via groep-chat en groepsgesprek. Daarbij is op elk moment de beschikbaarheid van uw collega’s inzichtelijk.

I AM is óók eenvoudig samenwerken door het delen van uw scherm, delen van bestanden, en integratie met Outlook contacten en agenda.

I AM is volledig geïntegreerd met de telefooncentrale. Collega's zien dat u in gesprek bent. Telefoon instellingen, zoals “niet storen” en doorschakelen, zijn te wijzigen.</description>
