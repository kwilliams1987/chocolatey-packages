# chocolatey-packages
My custom build Chocolatey Packages.

# Automatic Updates
A Github Action is executed every day at 06:00 UTC to check for updates to all packages except PHP Manager for IIS.

## NVIDIA GeForce Now
An auto-installer for the NVIDIA GeForce Now streaming software.

`choco install nvidia-geforce-now`

[Source Code](https://github.com/kwilliams1987/chocolatey-packages/tree/master/manual/nvidia-geforce-now)

[Package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/nvidia-geforce-now)

[Homepage](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/products/geforce-now/)

Since NVIDIA has a very fast release cycle for it's software, the package is tested at least once a week on a Monday.

A new package will be generated more often if someone reports the installer is broken.
